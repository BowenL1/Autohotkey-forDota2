# Autohotkey-forDota2
simplify Tinker in Dota2 without getting account banned.

Install Autohotkey first, download all this package to your computer.
When it shows Tinker! after click Tinker.ahk or Tinker.exe, hotkey runs sucessfully. Use Alt+Enter to suspend Hotkey.

Uinsg the basic function you need to specify tinker's spell with Q(quickcast), W(quickcast), E(cast), anykey, anykey, R(quickcast).
And all Six items need to use quickcast. 


Example: 
For mine setting, I'm using 2(SOUL RING), TAB(HEX), B(ETHEREAL BLADE), SPACE(BLINK), 1(SHIVA), V(BKB) in quickcast. none, none, c(Ethereal blade), none, ` (Shiva), none in CAST.
In case I want to use item without quickcast.

In this case, we could get spell combo
1. use soul ring before rearm everytime.
2. spell combo with D: Missile, Soul ring, Thereal blade, Shiva, Hex, Laser.
3. spell combo with f: Missile, Soul ring, BKB, Shiva, Hex, Laser.
4. spell combo with T: Soul ring, Shiva, Missile.
5. spell combo with Mouse Button 1: Thereal blade(to yourself), BKB
6. spell combo with Mouse Button 2: Thereal blade(to yourself), DEFENSE MATRIX
   
You can also modify the hot key by youself in Tinker,ahk file using Notepad.
